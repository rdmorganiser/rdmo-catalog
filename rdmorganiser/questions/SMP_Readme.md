# Preface
This questionnaire was developed by the [Max Planck Digital Library](https://www.mpdl.mpg.de) in the Collections area in late summer and autumn 2022. It can be used to create a software management plan in RDMO. Of course, we are always happy to receive feedback: rdmo@mpdl.mpg.de.

The catalogue is available under the CC0 licence (https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/), so that it can be freely (re)used. Changes and adaptations by the RDMO community are of course welcome and can easily be made via GitHub.

# General
This RDMO catalogue supports the writing of a Software Management Plan. This questionnaire was developed by the Max Planck Digital Library in the Collections area in late summer and autumn 2022. It can be used to create a software management plan in RDMO.
A software management plan (SMP) can help significantly with design, implementation and long-term availability. The essential advantage of an SMP filled out in advance is the explicit handling of the emerging research software with documented information. At the same time, it also makes it clearer which topics (fields) have not yet been solved or covered.

# Development
This catalogue was developed through many conversations and iterations. It represents an attempt or approximation of what a Software Management Plan could possibly be. The main focus from our side was on added value for scientists who write software for their research themselves, but have not learned how to do this or have learned it only a little. At the same time, such an SMP can also be helpful in advising information and infrastructure experts.

Furthermore, this SMP template was inspired by some documentations, specially:
* https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides/software-management-plans
* https://opencarp.org/about/software-management-plan
* https://zenodo.org/record/7248877

# Versions of the SMP Catalogue
| Version Number | Release Date | Description |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------- |

# Implementing
The catalogue uses the generic elements from RDMO. Therefore, all generic elements from "Conditions", "Domain", "Options" and "Questions" must already be implemented in advance.

# Transferability
This catalogue introduces many custom attributes, as the generic RDMO attributes do not always cover the specific aspects of software. For this reason, the existing views in RDMO cannot be used for this catalogue, or only to a very limited extent.

# Use outside RDMO
Due to multiple requests, we have created a template on the SMP for use outside of RDMO. The Word document is freely writable, has a CC0 and is freely available via https://doi.org/10.17617/2.3481986  (direct link to the docx. file: https://hdl.handle.net/21.11116/0000-000C-1076-D) for your own re-use.

# FAIR4RS Viewer
A viewer for the presentation of the FAIR4RS principles is available under views. Using the Viewer only makes sense in combination with the SMP catalogue. With other RDMO catalogue this special viewer with focus on research software is not helpful. For more information, see the corresponding readme at the Viewer.

# Talks on the Topic
There were also some presentations on the development of this catalogue by the Max Planck Digital Library. See, for example, at the E-Science Days 2023 in Heidelberg: https://hdl.handle.net/21.11116/0000-000C-B40F-9.

# Feedback
Of course, we are always happy to receive feedback: rdmo@mpdl.mpg.de.

 Does the software refer to other software projects or objects?

### Infrastructure

To what extend will infrastructure resources be required?

Is there already existing infrastructure for the software development? Where is the infrastructure hosted?
