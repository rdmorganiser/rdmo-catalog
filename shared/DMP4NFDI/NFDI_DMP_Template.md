# About the NFDI DMP Template


The main objective of DMP4NFDI is to support NFDI consortia in the development and provision of standardised data and software management plan services.
This catalog was created as part of this process and can be reused as a basic catalog. It is based on the [RDA maDMP schema](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard) and, in its first version, maps all entities provided by the RDA to date. All questions of the DFG checklist are completely integrated.

Many parties have contributed to the development of the NFDI Template Framework in its current form. We express our sincere thanks to all that participated in our workshops and provided valuable feedback on our work.
