# About the NFDI DMP Template

## History

The main objective of DMP4NFDI is to support NFDI consortia in the development and provision of standardised data and software management plan services.
This catalog was created as part of this process and can be reused as a basic catalog. It is based on the [RDA maDMP schema](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard) and, in its first version, maps all entities provided by the RDA to date. All questions of the DFG checklist are completely integrated.

There are also many other parties who have contributed to developing the NFDI Template Framework in its current form. We express our sincere thanks to all consortia participating in our  workshops and presentations, and providing feedback to our work. We also thank the LTA group for the productive collaboration, valuable input, and the helpful text modules provided. We are also grateful to PID4NFDI for their suggestions and contributions, and to Neelam Bhanupratap Vishen for her valuable input on data protection and legal aspects. 

This publication, as part of the DMP4NFDI service, was made possible by Base4NFDI. Base4NFDI is funded by DFG, as part of NFDI, under project number 521453681.
