# About the NFDI DMP Template

## History
This template was created as part of the work of the NFDI's basic service, DMP4NFDI. 
The main objective of DMP4NFDI is to support NFDI consortia in the development and provision of standardised data and software management plan services.
This catalog was created as part of this process and can be reused as a basic catalog. It is based on the [RDA maDMP schema](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard) and, in its first version, maps all entities provided by the RDA to date. All questions of the DFG checklist are completely integrated.
