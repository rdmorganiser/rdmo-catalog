# About the research data policy generator (FDNext)

# 1. Aim and purpose
Research data policies for research projects are becoming increasingly widespread - especially in collaborative projects. The Research Data Policy Generator was developed to support those responsible for RDM in research projects in the creation of a project-internal research data policy. The Research Data Policy Generator is primarily aimed at larger research projects and is intended to facilitate the development of a project-internal research data policy. It is designed as a questionnaire with predefined answer options and provides text modules as a formulation aid based on the selected answer options. The questionnaire is available in German and English.

# 2. FAQ
**What is the Research Data Policy Generator?**
The Research Data Policy Generator is a tool that supports you in creating a research data policy for your research project. It generates text modules based on your answers in the following questionnaire.
**What are the advantages of using the generator?**
Using the generator simplifies the process of policy creation and ensures that all relevant topics are covered.
**How does answering the questions in the generator work?**
For most questions, you can choose from pre-set answers and add customised wording if needed. Some questions require free text answers.
**Can I interrupt the questionnaire and continue later?**
Yes, you can interrupt your work at any time and continue at a later point. You can also use the navigation to jump back and forth between questions and do not need to work on them in the given order.
**In what form are the text modules output?**
After you have completed the questionnaire, you will receive an overview of all questions and answers that you can use to formulate your policy. This overview can be exported to a text processing programme and further edited.
**How long does it take to complete the questionnaire?**
Experience shows that it takes between 30 and 45 minutes to complete the questionnaire. Please note that the time for any upstream coordination processes in the team is not included.
**Do I have to answer all the questions in the questionnaire?**
No, all questions are optional. You only need to answer those that are relevant to your project.
**Where can I find examples of research data policies?**
You can find examples of research data policies at [forschungsdaten.org](https://www.forschungsdaten.org/index.php/Data_Policies).
**Is there any further help for creating a research data policy?**
Yes, in the publication ["Forschungsdaten-Policies für Forschungsprojekte: ein strukturierter Leitfaden"](http://dx.doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-16196) you will find additional guidance on how to create a project-internal research data policy.
**At what point during the project should the tool be used?**
We recommend creating a policy with our tool right at the beginning of the project so that you can commit to common goals in the team right from the start and have enough time for the necessary coordination processes.
 
## 3. Setting up the questionnaire
As a prerequisite, the standard attributes and options provided by the RDMO project must have been imported into your own RDMO instance. These can be downloaded from https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo-catalog/tree/master/rdmorganiser.
The question catalogue for creating a project research data policy also requires additional attributes and options, which can be found in the files fdnext_template_domain.xml and fdnext_template_options.xml. 
The following files must be imported into your own RDMO instance in the following order before importing the actual question catalogue (fdnext_template_questions.xml):  
1) fdnext_template_domain.xml (domain)  
2) fdnext_template_options.xml (options)

Only then can the question catalogue (fdnext_template_questions.xml) be imported correctly. If this is inadvertently imported first, the options and conditions are not linked and the catalogue does not function correctly. In this case, it helps to delete the question catalogue and import it again after importing the above-mentioned files.
