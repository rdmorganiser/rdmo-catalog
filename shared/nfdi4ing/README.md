# NFDI4ING DMP Template
* Date: 2024-09-13
* Version: 2.0.0
* compatible with RDMO version: 2.1.0+

This catalog was developed by NFDI4ING and can be used at https://rdmo.nfdi4ing.de

## About
This catalog is based on the DFG checklist: https://www.dfg.de/research_data/checklist

The offered answer options contain a considerable amount of engineering-specific information and differ to a large extent with the possible answer options of the generic DFG checklist.

Compared to version 1, extensive adjustments have been made to questions, option sets and, in some cases, attributes, so the catalog is only partially compatible with the previous version.

## Installation
The xml is a "full xml" export and contains all elements required for the import into RDMO.

The catalog makes use of the `{more}`-tag to hide and show parts of the text, available since RDMO release 2.1.0.
