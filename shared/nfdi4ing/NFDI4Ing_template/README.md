This questionnaire was developed by the RWTH University Library and has the same structure and attributes like the generic `dfg-checklist` questionnaire (https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo-catalog/tree/master/rdmorganiser/questions).

The offered answer options contain a considerable amount of engineer-specific information and differ to a large extent with the possible answer options of the generic DFG checklist.
