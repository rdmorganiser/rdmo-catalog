# Offboarding Checklist
Current Version: 2.0.0

**Goal**: Document key information about existing data when a project ends or a scientist leaves the research group.

The Offboarding Checklist was first created by Andreas Geißner, Peter Mewis, and Alexander Rapp in the *Archiving and Data Flows* special interest group within the network of research data management officers at TU Darmstadt. The checklist was later adapted and modified for easier use as an RDMO catalog.
