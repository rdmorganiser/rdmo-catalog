# About this template
This questionnaire was developed by the RWTH University Library as part of the DMP4NFDI project and has the same structure and attributes like the generic `dfg-checklist` questionnaire (https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo-catalog/tree/master/rdmorganiser/questions).
The offered answer options contain a considerable amount of chemical-specific information and differ to a large extent with the possible answer options of the generic DFG checklist.

## How to import
If you are on an RDMO Version of at least 2.0, you can just import the NFDI4Chem_Vorlage_RDMO_Vers.2.x.xml-template.
If you are on a lower Version than 2.0, import the NFDI4Chem_options_vor_RDMO-Vers2.xml first and after it the NFDI4Chem_template_vor_RDMO-Vers2.xml-template.
